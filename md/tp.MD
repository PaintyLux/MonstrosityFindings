# TP Gain

**MON** players don't seem to gain **TP** when fighting monsters in the same way as players, with the base **TP** gain per action seeming to be fixed, regardless of **Delay**.  \
Incoming player damage seems to provide **TP** based on **Delay**. \
*`dAGI` does not seem to be taken into account?  \*
*Not tested **Store TP** as of yet.*
